                    available on our site. If you participate in the Reviews within the Site, any information you disclose in such a submission
                    may be publicly available and you should exercise caution in deciding whether to disclose any personal, financial or
                    other sensitive information there.</p>
                <p>Adinba cannot prevent other persons who access this site from using submissions and personal information they find here,
                    even if their use of that information violates the law, or your personal privacy or safety. None of the submissions will

                    for any use or disclosure of any submissions.</p>
                <p>When participating in the Reviews, you should not assume that people are who they say they are, know what they say they know
                    or are affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated with. Information obtained in the Reviews may not be reliable
                    and it is not a good idea to trade or make any investment decision based solely or largely on information you cannot
                    confirm. We cannot be responsible for the content or accuracy of any information and shall not be responsible for any
                    trading or investment decisions made based on such information.</p>

                    of a third party or any law; (vi) any software or other materials that contain a virus or other harmful component, and

                    transmit or post on the Site or the forums. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right (but not the obligation)
                    to monitor the Site and the Reviews and the materials you transmit or post; to alter or remove any such materials (including,

                    or blocking of your access to this Web Site. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute

                    <strong>ABILITY TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS</strong>

                </p>
                <p>These Terms may be supplemented by additional terms posted at other locations on this Site, but these Terms will supersede
                    in the event of a conflict with such additional terms. These Terms and such additional terms constitute our entire agreement
                    with you regarding your use of this Web Site, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements

                    in these Terms is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision
                    hereof. The invalidity of any term, condition or provision of these Terms shall not affect the enforceability of those
                    portions deemed enforceable by applicable courts of law. These Terms do not, and shall not be construed to, create any
                    partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Adinba. You
                    may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our express
                    prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms
                    without restriction. Notices to you may be made via posting to the Site, by e-mail, or by regular mail, at Adinba’s discretion.
                    The Site may also provide notices of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying such notices or by providing
                    links to such notices. Without limitation, you agree that a printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in
                    electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to
                    the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained
                    in printed form. Adinba will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.</p>
